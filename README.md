# ScImage Benchmark: text to scientific image generation

# Introduction: 
ScImage————a benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific images from textual descriptions. ScImage assesses three key dimensions of understanding: spatial, numeric, and attribute comprehension, as well as their combinations. We evaluate seven models, GPT-4o, Llama, AutomaTikZ, Dall-E, StableDiffusion, GPT-o1 and Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct using two modes of output generation: code-based outputs (Python, TikZ) and direct raster image generation. Additionally, we examine four different input languages: English, German, Farsi, and Chinese.
