</p>

### 1. Prerequisites
#### The model is deployed on Google Colab ([Link](https://colab.research.google.com/)). Create a Jupyter notebook and paste the code to run the image-generating procedure. 
#### Before running the code, users should register an account on Stability.aiand obtain their API key from ([Link](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Generate/paths/1v2beta1stable-image1generate1sd3/post)).
### 2. Running
#### Once get step 1 done, copy the codes in ***StableDiffusion_generation_code.py*** and paste it to the notebook cell and run, the results are stored in a zip file named ***scientific_graphs***

</p>

### 1. Prerequisites
#### The model is deployed on Ali Dashscope LLM platform ([Link]("https://ram.console.aliyun.com/profile/access-keys?spm=5176.12818093_47.console-base_top-nav.dak.bf2616d0lkXuff")). One must register an account and initiate an API key before using it.
#### Once the registration is accomplished, running the image-generating procedure is similar to the previous step: create a Jupyter notebook and paste to code to run.
#### The notebook file can be created on Ali Dashscope ([Link](https://pai.console.aliyun.com/?regionId=cn-shanghai&spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.2009527fIl74xF&workspaceId=575413#/notebook/?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&resourceId=ALL&sortBy=GmtCreateTime&order=DESC)), it may also run on other platforms such as Google Colab as long as all configs are set up.
### 2. Running
#### Once get step 1 done, copy the codes in ***QWen_generation_code.py*** and paste it to the notebook cell and run, the results are stored in a zip file named *scientific_graphs*
